# Attack Modeling
- Methodology have an important role.
- Methodoligies can help with:
	- Consistency: run the same sets of tests or probes no matter who you are testing against.
	- Repeatability: gives you the ability to do the same tests every time you run the assessment.
	- Process improvement.
- Some testing/assessment methodologies:
	- Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)
	- Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)
	- [Cyber Kill Chain](cyber-kill-chain.md)
	- [Attack Lifecycle](attack-lifecycle.md)
	- [MITRE ATT&CK Framework](mitre-attack-framework.md)
