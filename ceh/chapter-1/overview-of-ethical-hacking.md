# Overview of Ethical Hacking
- It's believed that to protect against attacks, you have to be able to understand those attacks. Ideally, you need to replicate the attacks.
- Ethical hacking ~ penetration testing.
- Red teaming: a specific type of penetration test where testers are adversarial to the organization and network under test. A red teamer would actually act like an attacker, meaning they would try to be stealthy so as not to be detected.
- Challenging aspects: having to think like an attacker.
