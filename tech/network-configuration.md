# Network Configuration for Daily use

## Change DNS server
In Arch linux, open the `/etc/resolv.conf`, you'll see this:
```
# Generated by dhcpcd from wlp1s0.dhcp
# /etc/resolv.conf.head can replace this line
nameserver 192.168.1.1
# /etc/resolv.conf.tail can replace this line
```

Create `/etc/resolv.conf.head` to override this file.

Or add this line to the end of file `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` (recommend)
```
static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
```

After making change, should restart dhcpcd and NetworkManager service.
Use this command to verify:
```bash
( nmcli dev list || nmcli dev show ) 2>/dev/null | grep DNS
```
