# Overview of Ethics
- You are being entrusted with access to sensitive information and critical systems. To keep yourself viable as a professional, you need to behave and perform your work in an ethical manner.
- You will be sworn to keep information you obtain as part of your work private, paying particular attention to protecting the information and intellectual property of employers and clients.
- You can't damage anything you have access to as part of your employment or contract.
- *White-hat* hackers are people who always do their work for good. *(authorized)*
- *Black-hat* hackers are people who do bad things, generally actions that are against the law. *(unauthorized)*
- *Gray-hat* hackers are working for good, but they are using the techniques of black-hat hackers. *(semi-authorized)*
- As long as what you are being asked to do is not illegal and the scope of activities falls within systems run by the company you are working for, your work would be considered ethical.
- If you stray outside of the scope of systems, networks, and services, your actions would be considered unethical.
